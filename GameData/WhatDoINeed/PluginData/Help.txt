This is a simple mod designed to show on-screen what science parts are needed to support the selected contracts.  The display can be made transparent and click-through can be allowed to allow it to not interfere with the editor.  It is only available in the Editor (VAB or SPH)

This will also show what parts are needed to fulfil part testing contracts and vessel repair contracts

The mod will only show contracts for which parts are needed;  contracts such as rescues, recovery, etc. will not be shown.

The toolbar button looks like the following:

Clicking the button for this mod will bring up a simple window which will look similar to the following image:

<IMAGE=WhatDoINeed/PluginData/Textures/window.png>


The initial screen will initially show all active contracts.  At the bottom there will be six buttons:
    * Expand All       Expand all contracts
    * Collapse All    Collapse all contracts
    * Show Briefing   Show the briefings for the selected contracts.  This changes to Hide Briefing if they are being shown
    * Select           Click to open contract selection screen
    * Close            Close the window
    * Settings         Open the settings panel

The window will show the selected active contracts.  Initially all experiments will be shown, along with all 
the parts that can provide the experiment needed.  There is a button to the left of each contract, which will
allow you to collapse the experiments included in that contract.

Clicking on a part will spawn the part.  The windows will fade away for 5 seconds (changable in settings) to allow you to place the part on the vessel without interference.

Font Colors
    * Contacts will be shown in yellow.
    * If enabled, the briefing text will be white
    * Experiments will be shown in either red or green.  Green indicates that the vessel has the necessary part(s) for the experiment.  
    * Fulfilling parts (parts which can run the experiment):  Part color will be cyan.  A checkmark will be shown if the part is on the vessel.  Additionally, for parts which are already on the vessel, the number of those parts on the vessel will be shown in 
      parenthesis to the right of the part name

The Contract Selection screen will show a list of all active contracts.  You can deselect some or all of the active contracts on this screen.  Click the contract title to select those contracts you want to display or deselect, then click the Select Button.  Active contracts are shown in green, inactive will be shown in white

Clicking on the Part Window button (shown for certain experiments) will open up the part window:
