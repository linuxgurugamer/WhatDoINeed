This is a simple mod designed to show on-screen what science parts are needed to support the selected contracts.  The display can be made transparent and click-through can be allowed to allow it to not interfere with the editor.  It is only available in the Editor (VAB or SPH)

This will also show what parts are needed to fulfil part testing contracts and vessel repair contracts

The toolbar button looks like the following:

Clicking the button for this mod will bring up a simple window which will look similar to the following image:

<IMAGE=WhatDoINeed/PluginData/Textures/window.png>


The initial screen will initially show all active contracts.  At the bottom there will be three buttons:
    * Select        Click to open contract selection screen
    * Close         Close the window
    * Settings      Open the settings panel

The window will show the selected active contracts.  Initially all experiments will be shown, along with all 
the parts that can provide the experiment needed.  There is a button to the left of each contract, which will
allow you to collapse the experiments included in that contract.

Font Colors
    * Contacts will be shown in yellow.
    * If enabled, the briefing text will be white
    * Experiments will be shown in a light blue.  
    * Fulfilling parts (parts which can run the experiment):  The parts will be shown in either red or green.  
      Red means it is NOT part of the current vessel, green means it IS on the current vessel.  Additionally, 
      for parts which are already on the vessel, the number of those parts on the vessel will be shown in 
      parenthesis to the right of the part name


The Contract Selection screen will show a list of all active contracts.  You can deselect some or all of the active contracts on this screen.  Click the contract title to select those contracts you want to display or deselect, then click the Select Button.  Active contracts are shown in green, inactive will be shown in read

Clicking on the Settings button will change the window to display the settings:
